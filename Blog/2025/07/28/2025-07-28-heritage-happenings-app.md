Here is a screen shot of the updated app. Note the buttons have moved.

Fingers crossed: The jiggling that Nancy noticed is no longer an issue.

Updates include:


### Menu Bar

* Moved font size buttons to left, to help prevent you from changing font size by mistake
* Moved read-aloud button to right to it easier and faster to turn voice on and off
* The file icon was removed from the Stories post in order to help with making a more consistent menu body size.
* Updated the top menu bar to a more consistent height, so it is less "jumpy"
* Menu Bar background is now opaque and does not show the underlying text at all

### Font Sizing

* Two finger pinch to reduce or enlarge the text, has been dropped. It was causing too many random updates. Now you must push the A- or A+ buttons to reduce or enlarge the text.

### ReadAloud

* When ReadAloud is on, the icon has a bar to let you know, you can click again to turn it off.
* When you swipe to a new story, ReadAloud stops reading the old story and starts reading the new story.

### Readability

* Header font sizes have been reduced slightly to make a more consistent text size in each post.

### URL handling

* Homepage now displays with clean URL

So far the feedback from Val working with Carm and Yvonne has been very positive.

Please not that the current app is being deigned to work best on an iPad or tablet. Future versions will be designed to work on laptops and mobile phones. So please make and keep comments on what you see on a tablet only for now.
